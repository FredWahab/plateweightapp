plate weight app
this simple web app allows the user to input a weight for strength training. 
they can then select if it is for barbell or dumbell weights.
dumbell will divide the number weight by 2 to determine how much each dumbell should be.
barbell will subtract the barbell weight and then divide by 2 to output the weight for each side.
the barbell weight is 45lbs by default (olympic barbell weight) but can be changed by the user. 

this was made to make my life easer and not have to math while im exhausted from working out :)
